/* This code snippet is setting up a Redux store using the `configureStore` function from the
`@reduxjs/toolkit` library. It imports the `configureStore` function and a user reducer from a file
named `userSlice.js`. The user reducer is then added to the store configuration under the key
`user`. This configuration sets up the Redux store with the specified reducer, allowing the
application to manage its state using Redux. */
